- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZedKyu
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, building and designing websites, going out of my comfort zone and learning something new!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the most basic coding skills - zero coding experience :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to advance basic coding knowledge, learning how to code and ship API UX improvements
